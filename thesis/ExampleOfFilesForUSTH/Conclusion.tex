Three months of internship is precious for understanding many concepts of machine learning. Besides the work I have done, I have been thinking of improving the model and expanding the system. Rather than using only one photo for each class, we can apply Data Augmentation to broaden the training dataset but not making the user inconvenient in taking many photos. And I am thinking of creating a model smaller that can fit a mobile app. That way can expand the usage of this work to many devices.
